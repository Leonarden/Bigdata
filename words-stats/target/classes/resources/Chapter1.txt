It was dark by the time I reached Bonn, and I forced myself not to
succumb to the series of mechanical actions which had taken hold of
me in five years of traveling back and forth: down the station steps, up
the station steps, put down my suitcase, take my ticket out of my coat
pocket, pick up my suitcase, hand in my ticket, cross over to the
newsstand, buy the evening papers, go outside, and signal for a taxi.
Almost every day for five years I had left for somewhere and arrived
somwhere; in the morning I had gone up station steps and down again,
in the afternoon down the steps and up again, signaled for a taxi, felt in
my pockets for money to pay for my ticket, bought evening papers at
kiosks, and savored in a corner of my mind the studied casualness of
these mechanical actions. Ever since Marie left me to marry Züpfner,
that Catholic, these actions have become more mechanical than ever,
but without losing any of their casualness. There is a way of calculating
the distance from station to hotel, from hotel to station—by the taxi
meter. Two marks, three marks, four marks fifty from the station. Since
Marie has been gone I have sometimes slipped out of the rhythm and
confused the hotel with the station, I would start looking for my ticket
as I approached the hotel porter or ask the ticket collector at the
station for my room number, something—fate perhaps—must have made
me remember my profession and my situation. I am a clown, official 
description: comedian, no church affiliation, twenty-seven years old,
and one of my turns is called: Arrival and Departure, a long (almost too
long) pantomime during which the audience confuses arrival and
departure all the way through. Since I usually go over this number once
more in the train (it consists of over six hundred gestures, and I have
to know their sequence by heart, of course), it is not unnatural that
now and again I fall victim to my own imagination: rush into a hotel,
look round for the departure board, find it, run up or down a flight of
steps so as not to miss my train, while all I have to do is go to my
room and get ready for the performance. Luckily they know me in most
of the hotels. Over a period of five years a rhythm develops with fewer
possibilities of variation than one might suppose—besides, my agent,
who is familiar with my idiosyncrasies, sees to it that there is a
minimum of friction. What he calls “the sensitive soul of the artist” is
fully respected, and an “aura of well-being” surrounds me as soon as I
get to my room: flowers in an attractive vase, and, almost before I have
thrown off my coat and tossed my shoes (I hate shoes) into a corner, a
pretty chambermaid comes in with coffee and cognac and runs my
bath, and the green bath salts she pours into it make it relaxing and
fragrant. While I lie in the bathtub I read the papers, popular ones all of
them, sometimes as many as six but at least three, and in a moderately
loud voice I sing nothing but sacred songs: chorales, hymns, musical
passages I recall from my school days. My parents, devout
Protestants, subscribed to the postwar fashion of denominational 
tolerance and sent me to a Catholic school. I am not religious myself, I
don’t even go to church, and I make use of the sacred texts and
songs for therapeutic purposes: they help me more than anything else
to overcome the two afflictions Nature has saddled me with:
depression and headaches. Since Marie went over to the Catholics
(although Marie is a Catholic herself I feel this phrase is appropriate),
the intensity of these two complaints has increased, and even the
Tantum Ergo or the Litany of Loreto—till now my favorite remedies for
pain—are not much use any more. There is one temporarily effective
remedy: alcohol; there could be a permanent cure: Marie. Marie has left
me. A clown who takes to drink falls faster than a drunk tile-layer
topples off a roof.
When I am drunk my gestures during a performance become confused—
their only justification in the first place is their precision—and I fall into
the most embarrassing trap to which a clown is ever exposed—I laugh
at my own tricks. A ghastly humiliation. As long as I am sober my stage
fright increases till the moment I walk on (I generally had to be
pushed), and what some critics have called “that reflective, critical
gaiety hiding a beating heart” was nothing but the desperate icy
control with which I turned myself into a puppet; it was terrible,
incidentally, when the thread broke and I fell back on myself. I imagine
monks go through a similar experience when they are in a state of
contemplation. Marie always carried around a lot of mystical literature,
and I remember the words “empty” and “nothing” occurred very often.
For the past three weeks I had been drunk most of the time and had
gone on stage with a deceptive air of confidence, the consequences
showed up faster than with a slacker in school who still retains
illusions about himself right up until he gets his report; six months is a
long time to dream. After three weeks there were already no more
flowers in my room, by the middle of the second month I no longer had
a room with bath, and by the beginning of the third month the distance
from the station was already seven marks, while my fee had shrunk to
a third. Instead of cognac, gin, instead of vaudeville theaters, curious
clubs which met in gloomy halls where I went on stage with wretched
lighting, where my performance no longer even consisted of confused
gestures but was reduced to outright clowning for the benefit of the
postal and railway employees celebrating twenty-five years of service,
or of Catholic housewives and Protestant nurses, and where 
the beerdrinking army officers whose promotion celebrations I enlivened hardly
knew whether they ought to laugh or not when I did what was left of
my “Defense Council” act; and yesterday, in Bochum, before an
audience of young people, I slipped in the middle of a Chaplin imitation
and couldn’t get up. There weren’t even any catcalls—just a
sympathetic murmuring, and when at last the curtain fell I quickly
hobbled off, gathered up my belongings and, without removing my
make-up, took a cab to my boarding-house where there was a terrible
row because my landlady refused to let me have any money for the
taxi. The only way I could placate the disgruntled taxi driver was to 
hand over my electric razor—not as security but as payment. He was
decent enough to give me change in the form of a nearly full pack of
cigarettes and two marks in cash. I lay down fully dressed on the
unmade bed, drank the rest of my bottle, and for the first time in
months felt completely rid of depression and headache. I lay on my bed
in a state which I sometimes hope will be mine when I end my days:
drunk and as if in the gutter. I would have given my shirt for a drink,
and only the thought of the complicated negotiations involved in such
an exchange discouraged me from undertaking this transaction. I slept
marvelously—long and deep, and dreamed that the heavy stage curtain
fell over me like a soft thick shroud, yet through sleep and dreams I
was aware of my fear of waking up: the make-up still on my face, my
right knee swollen, a lousy breakfast on a plastic tray and next to the
coffee pot a wire from my agent: “Coblenz and Mainz have canceled
stop phoning tonight Bonn. Zohnerer.” Then a call from the organizer
of last night’s show who, I discovered, was head of the Christian
Education Society. “Kostert speaking,” came his voice over the phone,
a mixture of coldness and servility, “we have to clear up the matter of
your fee, Mr. Schnier.” “By all means,” I said, “there’s nothing to stopyou.”
“Oh?” he replied. I said nothing, and when he went on his petty
hostility had turned to downright sadism. “We agreed on a fee of a
hundred marks for a clown who used to be worth two hundred”—he
paused, presumably to give me a chance to be angry, but I was silent 
and, true to type, he became insulting again and said: “I am the
chairman of a welfare organization, and my conscience won’t allow me
to pay a hundred marks for a clown for whom twenty is a more than
adequate—one might even say, a generous fee.” I saw no reason to
break my silence. I lit a cigarette, poured out some more of the lousy
coffee, and listened to his heavy breathing. He said, “Are you
listening?” And I said: “I’m listening,” and waited. Silence is a good
weapon. When I was at school and got called up before the principal or
the teachers I always kept silent. I let the Christian Mr. Kostert sweat
it out back there at the other end of the line; he was too small to feel
sorry for me, but not too small to feel sorry for himself, and finally he
muttered: “Well, what would you suggest, Mr. Schnier?”
“Now listen carefully, Kostert,” I said, “I’ll make you a deal—take a
taxi, drive to the station, get me a first-class ticket to Bonn, buy me a
bottle of schnapps, come to the hotel, pay my bill—including tips—and
leave an envelope here containing enough money for me to pay for a
taxi to the station. Furthermore, undertake on your Christian
conscience to pay for sending my luggage to Bonn. O.K.?”
He did some mental arithmetic, cleared his throat, and said: “But my
idea was to give you fifty marks.”
“All right,” I said, “take the streetcar then—that way the whole thing
will cost you less than fifty marks. How about that?”
He did some more mental arithmetic and said: “Couldn’t you take your
luggage with you in the taxi?”
“No I couldn’t,” I said, “I’ve hurt my knee and can’t be bothered.”
Evidently his Christian conscience began to make itself felt. “Mr.
Schnier,” he said in a mild voice, “I’m sorry I—” “Never mind,
Kostert,” I said, “I am ever so glad I can save the Christian cause
between fifty-four and fifty-six marks.” I pressed down the hook and
put the receiver down by the phone. He was the type who would have
called back and spent half an hour relieving his conscience—it was
much better to leave him to pick around in it by himself. I felt sick. I
forgot to say that not only do I suffer from depression and headaches
but I also have another, almost mystical peculiarity: I can detect smells
through the telephone, and Kostert gave off a sickly odor of violet
cachous. I had to get up and clean my teeth. Then I gargled with some
of the cognac that was left, laboriously removed my makeup, got into
bed again, and thought of Marie, of Christians, of Catholics, and
contemplated the future. I thought of the gutters I would lie in one day.
For a clown approaching fifty there are only two alternatives: gutter or
palace. I had no faith in the palace, and before reaching fifty I had
somehow to get through another twenty-two years. The fact that
Coblenz and Mainz had canceled was what Zohnerer would call the
“Early Warning Stage,” but there was another quality to be taken into
account which I forgot to mention: my laziness. There were gutters in
Bonn too, and who said I was to wait till I was fifty?
I thought of Marie: of her voice and her breast, her hands and her hair,
her movements and everything we had done with each other. Also of 
Züpfner, whom she wanted to marry. We had known each other quite
well as boys—so well that when we met again as grown men we didn’t
quite know whether to use first names or not—either way we felt
embarrassed, and we never got over this embarrassment no matter
how often we met. I couldn’t understand how Marie could have gone
over to him of all people, but perhaps I never “understood” Marie.
I was furious when it was Kostert who aroused me from my thoughts.
He scratched at the door like a dog and said: “Mr. Schnier, you must
listen to me. Do you need a doctor?” “Leave me alone,” I called out,
“shove the envelope under the door and go home.”
He pushed the envelope under the door, I got out of bed, picked it up,
and opened it: it contained a second-class ticket from Bochum to
Bonn, and the taxi fare had been calculated exactly: six marks fifty. I
had hoped he would make it a round figure of ten marks, and I had
already worked out how much I would get out of it if I turned in the
first-class ticket and bought a second-class one. It would have been
about five marks. “Everything all right?” he called from outside. “Yes,”
I said, “and now get out, you lousy little Christian worm.” “Now wait a
minute! You can’t—” he said, and I shouted, “Get out!” There was
silence for a moment, then I heard him go downstairs. The children of
this world are not only smarter, they are also more humane and more
generous than the children of light. I took the streetcar to the station
so as to save a bit for a drink and some cigarettes. The landlady
charged me for a telegram I had sent the evening before to Monika 
Silvs in Bonn and which Kostert had refused to pay for, so anyway I
wouldn’t have had enough money for a taxi to the station; I had sent
the telegram before discovering that Coblenz had canceled: they had
got in ahead of me, and that annoyed me a bit. It would have been
better for me if I could have canceled and sent a wire saying “Unable
to appear on account of serious knee injury.” Well, at least the
telegram had gone off to Monika: “Please prepare flat for tomorrow.
Regards. Hans.”
